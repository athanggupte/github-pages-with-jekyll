I realised that a developer in today's world is practically invisible if he/she/they does not write a blog. So I figured I should start writing one myself.  
But I faced 2 problems- 
- Where to post the blogs?
- What to write?

Well the first question had an easy answer... **Github Pages**.  
And so, I started a course on how to publish static pages on Github Pages, on Github Learning Lab. And this is it... the __First Post__.  

I still don't know the full answer to the second question :see_no_evil::joy:
